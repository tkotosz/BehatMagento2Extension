Feature: Injecting service from Magento DI to Behat Context through the constructor
  As a developer
  In order to write Behat tests easily
  I should be able to inject services from the Magento DI into Behat Contexts through the constructor

  Background:
    Given I have the feature:
      """
      Feature: My awesome feature

    And I have the context:

      {
          /** @var ProductRepositoryInterface */
